TODO list for the eggs game:

 * In some windows (e.g., Cash Flow), it's not obvious what keys to press.

 * Screen refresh loses track of cashflow mode, current focused widget

 * It may still be too hard to keep making breeding and genetic
   progress after the first ngp(), especially when selling chickens
   only for meat.  This needs play testing with a fresh account/game.

 * When frame content doesn't all fit (e.g., in the Messages frame),
   draw the scrollbar even when in the home position, to signal that
   scrolling is possible.
 
 * Playtest / balance genetic engineering.

 * The budget window should get re-initted when budget items unlock.

 * Budget items should either stay unlocked after ngp(), or reset to
   default values, perhaps both.  Genetic engineering, notably, gets
   locked but retains its old value, which is wrong.

Maybe Fixed (TEST):

 * Changing the window size and then refreshing, messes up the Messages window.
