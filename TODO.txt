TODO list for the eggs game:

 * In some windows (e.g., Cash Flow), it's not obvious what keys to press.

 * Screen refresh loses track of cashflow mode, current focused widget

 * It's too hard to keep making breeding and genetic progress after ngp(),
   especially when selling chickens only for meat.

 * Allow scrolling frame content when it doesn't all fit (e.g., in the Messages frame).
 
 * Playtest / balance genetic engineering.

 * Test the per-user config file options saving.

 * Add loss conditions, e.g., if you have no chicks or laying hens and can't afford to buy any.

 * The budget window should get re-initted when budget items unlock.

 * Budget items should either stay unlocked after ngp(), or reset to default values, perhaps both.

Maybe Fixed (TEST):

 * Changing the window size and then refreshing, messes up the Messages window.

 * Add an option to automatically pause immediately after NGP.
